 ### ideas:
 - enemies dead animation,
 - player dead animation,
 - fly chaotic movement,
 - shop for health containers,
 - coins drops from enemies,

 - if player has collected exact amount of coins(or more), arrow shows way to the doors,
 - red fly,
 - spider enemy,
 - better enemy movement animations,
 - sword attack?
 - items mini shake animation,


 ### fix:
