 # My tiny todo list ^^
 ### ideas:
 - increase player gravity when holding down key,
 - enemies dead animation with white shader,
 - player dead animation,
 - player hit animation,
 - vulnerability time for player?
 - shop for health containers,
 - coins drops from enemies,
 - enemy that shoots projectiles,
 - music and sound effects,
 - controller input,
 - stars for completing % of the level?
 - if player has collected exact amount of coins(or more), arrow shows way to the doors,
 - red fly,
 - random traps,
 - hidden snail blocks the player,
 - luceg, just luceg,
 - add snek,
 - sword attack?


 ### fix:
- better enemy movement animations,
- movement animation for snail,
- error when player kills snail,
- FlyEnemy and FlyEmemy2 on level 2 are (sometimes) flying towards player right away when the scene is loaded,
- player konckback,
