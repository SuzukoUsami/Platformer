 # My tiny todo list ^^
 ### ideas:
 - enemies dead animation,
 - player dead animation,
 - fly chaotic movement,
 - shop for health containers,
 - coins drops from enemies,
 - music and sound effects,
 - achievments,
 - if player has collected exact amount of coins(or more), arrow shows way to the doors,
 - red fly,
 - spider enemy,
 - better enemy movement animations,
 - sword attack?
 - items mini shake animation,
 - new biomes,
 - more levels,
 

 ### fix:
 - loading when no save file is present,
 - fix shaders when snail, fly and fire worm are hit,
 - fireworm not shooting when player stands next to him,
